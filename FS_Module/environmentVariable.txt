An environment is a set of variables you can use in your Postman requests.
You can use environments to group related sets of values together and manage
access to shared Postman data if you are working as part of a team.


An environment in Postman is a set of key-value pairs. An environment helps
us to differentiate between the requests. When we create an environment inside
Postman, we can change the value of the key value pairs and the changes are 
reflected in our requests. An environment just provides boundaries to variables.


When we create different environment we can make track of all the variables and how 
to use them inside our requests. There can be many variables inside one environment. 
At once, we can work only in one environment although we can create any number of 
environments in Postman
